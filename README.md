## üõ†Ô∏è Application Features

  -  Automated Data Retrieval: Real-time querying of Companies House API, resolving messy company names (Ltd, LLC, Plc, etc.).
  -  Comprehensive Entity Profiles: Extraction of company officers, persons of significant control (PSC), charges, insolvency history, SIC code-based industry categorization.

I create 2 versions of the application which can be found in app_v1.R and app_v2.R, attempting UI optimization
